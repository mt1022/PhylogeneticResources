### Phylogenetic Resources
Collection of phylogenetic resources.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Multiple Sequence Alignment
#### [ClustalW](http://www.clustal.org/)

#### [Muscle](https://www.drive5.com/muscle)
MUSCLE was configure for best accuracy [by default](https://www.drive5.com/muscle/manual/accurate.html). Parameters for fastest speed is available [here](https://www.drive5.com/muscle/manual/fastest.html). It could also build UPGMA or NJ tree.

#### [Prank](http://wasabiapp.org/software/prank/)
Manual available [here](http://wasabiapp.org/software/prank/). Prank could back-translate AA alignment to DNA alignment. Note:
> `-F` specifies that the inference of insertions should be trusted and sites appearing as insertions should not be aligned at the later stages of the process ... if option -F is omitted, the algorithm does not incorrectly penalise for gaps for insertions but it will also not guarantee to leave the insertions unmatched.

#### [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/)
Official suggestions for choosing which program to use are available [here](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/about.html). Manuals available at [Algorithms](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/algorithms/algorithms.html) and [Tips](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/tips0.html).

#### Phylogenetic tree resconstruction
##### [IQ-TREE](iqtree.org)
IQ-TREE could perform model selection, Maximum-likelihood tree reconstruction, and branch support assessment by bootstrap.
[Documentation](http://www.iqtree.org/doc/) is comprehensive and well-organized.

#### Online tools
Visualize and manipulate tree
- [Interactive Tree Of Life](https://itol.embl.de/): display, annotation and management of phylogenetic trees.
- [Phylotree.js](http://phylotree.hyphy.org/): visualize and label branches in phylogenetic trees.
